# SecurePass Vault – A Console-Based Password Manager (C++ & DSA)

SecurePass Vault is a console-based C++ application which is a lightweight password manager. It demonstrates how Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) can be applied to solve real-world problems like secure storage, fast retrieval, and efficient organization of sensitive data.

## 🔐Features

User Authentication → Master password protected (with hashing).

Organized Storage → Passwords stored by website using HashMap.

Fast Search → Autocomplete and prefix-based search with Trie.

Password History → Restore old passwords using Stack/Doubly Linked List.

Auto-Vault Cleanup → Auto-delete least-used/oldest passwords using Queue or Priority Queue.

Strong Password Generator → Backtracking/random generation with rules.

Encryption Simulation → Encoded storage for added security.

File Persistence → Save and load vault data from local file system.

Tech & Concepts Used

## C++ (OOP + STL)

DSA: HashMap, Trie, Stack, Queue, Priority Queue, Backtracking.

File Handling: Serialization for vault persistence.

Security Basics: Hashing + Encryption simulation.
